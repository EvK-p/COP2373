Program Description: 
        In this program, Python is going to create a monthly expense program that'll show the user what they spent in a month, what they paid the most and what they paid the least on.


Logical Steps:
        [Step 1: The reduce function is primed with the functools module.]
        [Step 2: The list of expenses the user is going to input is defined.]
        [Step 3: The program that'll calculate the total amount spent, highest and lowest expediture is defined.]
        [Step 4: User is asked to enter one of their monthly payments.]
        [Step 5: User is then asked how much it cost.]
        [Step 6: Repeat Step 4 through 5 until the user chooses 'done'.]
        [Step 7: The information is calculated.]
        [Step 8: Results are displayed and the loop stops.]


Variables:
        [1: expenses (Line 5): The variable where the user inputs are stored as a list.]
        [2: type_of_expense (Line 21): The input variable that'll contain user input]
        [3: amount (Line 26): Prices of the payments.]
        [4: total_expense (Line 33): Runs the grand total calulator.]
        [5: highest_expense (Line 34): Runs the highest expense calculator.]
        [6: lowest_expense (Line 35): Runs the lowest expense calculator.]


Functions:
        1. Function Name: [calculate_expenses]  
       	Description: [This function calculates the total amount in dollars of all of the prices given by the user.]  
       	Parameters: [expenses]  
       	Returns: [A float representing the total sum of all expense amounts]
        2. Function Name: [highest_amount]  
       	Description: [This function calculates which of all the prices given has the highest dollar amount.]  
       	Parameters: [expenses]  
       	Returns: [A tuple containing the type of expense (string) and the amount (float) of the highest expense.]
	      3. Function Name: [amount_lowest]  
      	Description: [This function finds the lowest priced monthly payment out of the list.]  
       	Parameters: [expenses]  
       	Returns: [A tuple containing the type of expense (string) and the amount (float) of the lowest expense.]
