Program Description:
        In this program, Python is going to ask the user to input an email they recieved. Afterwards, the program is going to flag certain words based on a list it creates and create a spam point meter and level of potential scam.


Logical Steps:
        [Step 1: The program defines the list of 30 common words in spam emails]
        [Step 2: A text file is also created for the program to call back to]
        [Step 3: The second function is defined, the one that'll ask for user input]
        [Step 4: Text is displayed asking for user input]
        [Step 5: The spam score, phrase_counts and found_phrases variables are started at zero]
        [Step 6: for if statement is created so that when a key word is detected, it will add a point to the spam_score and will display how many times the key word was said]
        [Step 7: The tiers of spam_likelihood are created with an elif function]
        [Step 8: The spam score, spam likelihood tier and the found phrases are displayed]
        [Step 9: common_spam_words and ask_user are called]


Variables:
        [1: common_spam_words:]
