Program Description:
This program is going to analyze exam grades from 3 tests that 10 students took, and then calculate and print their results, providing if they passed or not.

Logical Steps:
	[Step 1: Open the grades.csv file and extract the scores into a numpy array.]
	[Step 2: Print the first couple rows of the extracted scores.]
	[Step 3: Calculate and display the mean, median, standard deviation, mix, and max for each exam.]
	[Step 4: Determine if the students passed of failed, based on a grade more than 60 being passing, and less than 60 failing.]
	[Step 5: Calculate the total percentage of students who passed all the exams.]
	[Step 6: Print all statistics in user-friendly format.]

Variables:
	[1 filename: A string representing the name of the CSV file to load]
	[2 data: numpy array containing the extracted exam scores.]
	[3 num_rows: An integer defining the number of rows to display when displaying the first few rows.]
	[4 passing_grade: Integer representing the minimum passing score.]
	[5 all_scores: A 1D numpy array containing all the exam scores.]

	4. Function Name: [calculate_overall_statistics]
	Description: [Computes the overall statistics]
	Parameters: [data]

	5. Function Name: [pass_fail_statistics]
	Description: [Calculates and prints the number of students who passed or failed.]
	Parameters: [data]
	    [passing_grade]
	Returns: [N/A]

	6. Function Name: [overall_pass_percentage]
	Description: [Calculates and prints the overall pass percentage across all the tests.]
	Parameters: [data]
	    [passing_grade]
	Returns: [N/A]

	7. Function Name: [main]
	Description: [Coordinates the execution of the program.]
	Parameters: [N/A]
	Returns: [N/A]
